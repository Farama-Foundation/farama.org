    <h3 class="text-primary">How to Submit Projects</h3>

    If you would like your reinforcement learning project to be maintained by us long
    term, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:jkterry@farama.org">jkterry@farama.org</a>. In general, we're only looking
    for projects that have already become widely used or clearly have a profound
    technical use in the field if they're not currently widely used. We work to bring all
    new and existing projects to our <a href="project_standards">standards</a>, and generally request that new
    projects meet the vast majority of these requirements before submission (though
    please reach out to us if you have any questions)
