            Who we are and what we do
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            The Farama Foundation is a 501c3 nonprofit organization designed to house major open source reinforcement
            learning (“RL”) libraries in a neutral nonprofit body. We aim to provide <a
                href="/project_standards">standardization</a> and long term
            maintenance for these <a href="/projects">libraries</a>, as well as improvements to their reproducibility,
            performance, and quality
            of life features.
            <br>
            We are a large international <a href="/team">team</a> in charge of many of the most installed libraries in
            the field, such as
            <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org">Gymnasium</a> (formerly <a
                href="https://github.com/openai/gym">Gym</a>) and <a
                href="https://pettingzoo.farama.org">PettingZoo</a>, and are <a href="/submit_projects">open to new projects</a> when it's a good fit.
            Our team
            previously maintained OpenAI Gym for 18 months before development moved into Gymnasium. We are also working
            to develop new key pieces of software that are missing in the open source reinforcement learning ecosystem.

            Our goals
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            We want to improve the tools for academic research in reinforcement learning, to make it easier, faster,
            more productive, and more scientifically rigorous.
            <br>
            We want to create open source RL tools that “just work”, reducing the engineering workload required to apply
            reinforcement learning to real world problems and making novel forms of automation feasible.
            <br>
            We want to make “RLops” a thing the way MLops is.
