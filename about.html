        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            The Farama Foundation is 501c3 nonprofit organization designed to serve a Linux Foundation-esque role of
            housing
            major existing open source reinforcement learning (“RL”) libraries in a neutral nonprofit body, as well as
            to
            provide standardization, long term maintenance and reproducibility, performance and quality of life
            improvements
            to these projects and to develop key pieces of missing software for the open source reinforcement learning
            ecosystem.

            Our goal in this work is to speed up RL research, reduce the engineering workload required to use
            RL, and ensure reproducibility of experiments.

            What we do
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            We're in charge of many of the most installed <a href="/projects.html">reinforcement learning libraries</a>
            in the world and are made of of a large international <a href="/team.html">team</a> of core contributors.
            Aside from offering long term maintenance, our major goals for the environments we manage is
            <a href="/project_standards.html">standardizing</a> them to make switching
            between different environments as seamless as possible, to add key developer quality of life improvements,
            and to ensure key reproducibility features are present. Some of the largest quality of features we're
            working to add are consistent detailed documentation websites (like the ones we created for Gymnasium,
            PettingZoo, Minigrid and Gymnasium-Robotics), easy installation, support for multiple architectures and
            operating systems, type hinting, docstrings, and improved rendering functionality. We classifying our
            projects into two classes - “Mature” ones that comply with these
            <a href="/project_standards.html">standards</a>, and “Incubating” ones where we're still working to
            bring them up to our standards.
        </p>

        <!-- <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            We also have an [initial](link) and [follow up](link) blog post that explains what exactly
            we're
            doing in a lot more depth.
