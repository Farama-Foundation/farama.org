    <h1>How to Submit Projects</h1>
    <div>
        If you'd like your reinforcement learning project to us to be maintained long term,
        please reach out to us at jkterry@farama.org. In general, we're only looking for
        projects that have already become widely used or clearly have a profound technical
        use in the field if they're not currently widely used. We work to bring all new and
        existing projects to our <a href="#standards">standards</a>, and generally request that new projects meet
        the vast majority of these requirements before submission (though please reach out
        to us if you have any questions).
