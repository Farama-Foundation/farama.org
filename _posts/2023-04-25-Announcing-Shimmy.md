Reinforcement learning (RL) environments and benchmarks use a range of different APIs, and often lack compatibility with standard training libraries. 
This results in a fractured ecosystem, and creates single-problem solutions that cannot be easily adapted to new domains. 

[//]: # (Have you ever wanted to use [dm-control]&#40;https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control&#41; with [stable-baselines-3]&#40;https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3&#41;, or train other non-gymnasium based environments with standard learning libraries?)

To address this issue, we are excited to announce [Shimmy](https://shimmy.farama.org/)--an API compatibility tool for converting external RL environments to the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) APIs.
This allows users to access a wide range of single and multi-agent environments, all under a single standard API.

As detailed in the [Announcing The Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/Announcing-The-Farama-Foundation) blog post, our greater goal at Farama is to create a unified and user-friendly ecosystem for open-source reinforcement learning software--for use both in research and in industry. Shimmy plays an important role in this plan, by integrating external RL environments inside the Farama ecosystem.

Shimmy will continue to be maintained as a long-term utility, ensuring that popular RL environments are compatible with up-to-date APIs. We plan to add additional environments as we see fit, and welcome new contributions or suggestions.

### Environments

Shimmy includes API compatibility for the following environments: 

**Single-agent (Gymnasium wrappers):**
- [DeepMind Control](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control)
- [DeepMind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab)
- [DeepMind Behavior Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) - [V21](https://github.com/openai/gym/releases/tag/v0.21.0) (before breaking API changes)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) - [V26](https://github.com/openai/gym/releases/tag/0.26.0) (after breaking API changes, final release)
- [Arcade Learning Environments ](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)

**Multi-agent (PettingZoo wrappers):**
- [DeepMind OpenSpiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel)
- [DeepMind Control: Soccer](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/blob/main/dm_control/locomotion/soccer/README.md)
- [DeepMind Melting Pot](https://github.com/deepmind/meltingpot)

### Key Features
Shimmyâ€™s [documentation](https://shimmy.farama.org/) contains an overview of each environment, as well as full usage scripts and installation instructions--allowing users to easily load and interact with environments without digging through source code. 

We include automated testing for each environment, to ensure that converted environments are fully functional and are held to the same standards as native [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) environments.

Shimmy additionally provides full installation scripts for external environments which are not available in distributed releases (via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) or elsewhere), and [Dockerfiles](https://shimmy.farama.org/content/getting_started/#docker) which can be used to install on any platform (e.g., [DeepMind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab) does not support Windows or macOS).

For more information, see Shimmy 1.0.0 release notes.
